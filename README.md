# WP Pager plugin for WordPress

WP Pager is a WordPress plugin for displaying images in a form of a restaurant menu. The main advantage of such plugin is that you can turn pages of the menu by swiping on mobile and desktop devices.

The main purpose of this plugin is to give users a filling of a real restaurant menu where they can turn pages and see the whole menu.

> I'm keeping the project with PSR-12 code style, so please, make sure that you are using the same code style. For convenience, there is a Laravel Pint formatter that formats your code automatically. You can read more about Laravel Pint [here](https://laravel.com/docs/pint)
